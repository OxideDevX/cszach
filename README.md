# Hi there :wave:

Nice to meet you. My name is Duong (not Nguyen). I am a student. Computer
programming is one of my biggest hobbies (the others being designing
:triangular_ruler:, thinking :thinking:, and dancing :cartwheeling:).

Currently I am very interested in computer graphics (both the technical aspect
and the artistic aspect). My dream is to elevate the classroom experience by
integrating 3D computer graphics, as well as to create beautiful 3D art.
:rainbow: I also love the Web and am trying to combine 3D content with Web
technologies. :technologist:

I'm on [GitHub][github], [Dribbble][dribbble], [Unsplash][unsplash], and
[Medium][medium]. Oh and also [OpenProcessing][openprocessing] and
[Instagram][instagram].

## Things I deal with on the computer

- JavaScript (currently three.js, Node.js, and plain JS :sunglasses:)
- GNU Bash
- Jekyll :sparkling_heart:
- Markdown
- ...and more!

I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) :atom: and push my code to GitHub :octocat: (not
elsewhere). [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is how
I browse the Web. I use ~~Arch btw~~ [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) because it
is super duper cool :sunglasses:.

## Stuff I'm working on

### lnagb.js

</a>

A Linear Algebra JavaScript library. Comes with rich APIs, handy & diverse
modules, detailed documentation, linear algebra resources, references, and more! 
Reduce matrices, solve equations, draw vectors, make calculations, integrate
with three.js, etc. Made for students, by a student. Languages of Linear
Algebra, JavaScript, Liquid, Markdown, and love involved. :heart: Visit
<https://vecma-org.github.io/lnagb.js> if you are interested!

### 3D sketches

</a>

Sketches made for fun by me. Exist in the third dimension, can be seen via a flat
screen. :smiley: These are mostly done using three.js, but models made in 3D
modeling programs (like Microsoft Paint 3D) are also there. It's like a showcase
of things I've made with three.js + what I've modeled with desktop programs. I'm
looking forward to making the content more diverse, such as adding VR content
using A-Frame or pseudo-3D illustrations using Zdog! See my sketches at
<https://you-create.github.io/three.js-sketches>. Still gradually growing in
numbers! I hope I will be able to make a new one every week.

### The Better README Project

A small but nice project that aims to help developers write the best README
documents in the world, because why not? :wink: READMEs are important you know,
that's why [Readme Driven Development][rdd] is a thing. There are still a lot to
do with the project, and I hope exciting things will come in the near future.

### Personal website

Yep, I'm making my time to work on my personal website :sunglasses:. I am
particularly so excited about this one, can't wait to see how it will turn out!
The website will include links to my online profiles, my art, my Markdown
writings, my sketches, and my blog. :wink:

## What I want to learn in the future

_**Everything**_ OMG :sob:

Since I'm a human being and cannot specialize in everything, I guess I will
focus on...

- WebGL, GLSL & so on
- C++
- Python
- English :trollface:
- _probably_ one more foreign language
- Soft skills :bowtie:
- ...and many more of course
